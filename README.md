# Read Your World

A neat website that connects to your Goodreads account and checks how much of the world you've read.

It accepts both your Goodreads profile URL or your profile id and shows the world map with the countries from which you read your books.

## Local Deployment

If you are keen on using Docker, just run the following commands:

```sh
docker build -t read-the-world .   

docker docker run -p 3002:3001 read-the-world
```

Or if you're running services direclty, you can run the commands:

```sh
cd frontend && npm run build   

cd .. && node server.js
```

## Local Development

If you wish to change anything, just run both services separetly

```sh
cd frontend && npm run dev   
```

and in another terminal

```sh
node server.js
```
